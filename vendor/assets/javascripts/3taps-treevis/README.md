Hierarchical Visualisations for 3taps
=====================================

Treemaps
--------

See `treemap/treemap.html`.  You can search for keywords and see the treemap
animate to the new breakdown.  You can also select between category and
location dimensions, or both.  Tooltips show the number of results in each
rectangle.

The search is limited to `source="CRAIG"` at the moment.

To do
-----

 * HTML-based fallback for Internet Explorer?

Other
-----

There are some other demos in various directories, with dummy data.  I will
hopefully get a chance to convert these to use the 3taps API.
